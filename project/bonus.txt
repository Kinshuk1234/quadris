Bonus features

These are activated through command line when user enables bonus features of Quadris. 
1) We added the feature to make the tenth block disappear when user is not able to clear at least one row. 
We maintained a count inside each block and itís incremented with every drop of new block. 
Once that count reaches 10, we check if any row has been deleted. If none of the rows have been deleted, 
then we delete every cell of that block, thus eventually deleting the entire block.

2) The CommandInterpreter has an extra feature to add new command or rename an existing command. 
Whenever a user enters a ìnewcomî command, it prompts the user to enter a new command name. 
And then it takes a list of primitive commands to create a macro command until user is done. If user wants to rename any command, 
then the old command is deleted and replaced with new command.  
 
3) Skip deletes the current block and spawns a new block. If the new block cannot be legally fitted in the board,
then game is over. Or else, the game proceeds in the usual way.
